                    <h1>Sobahouse Konjiki Hototogisu</h1>
                    <p>
                        Being one of the Michelin starred Ramen shops in Tokyo Konjiki Hototogisu has a presence of its own.<br>
                        Their specialty bowl is a salty Ramen with red sea bream, clams and a dashi from dried produce. When served it is topped with truffle sauce and the fragrance of porcini oil. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a additional topping you can get a slice of their characteristic roasted Iberico pork. All this rich flavour is then being garnished with edible winter cherry sauce.<br>
                        The combination is so unique and make this a great experience. As a bonus this is probably one of the most affordable Michelin starred meals you can grab.

                    <h1>Sosakumenkobo Nakiryu</h1>
                    <p>
                        The signature Ramen bowls of Kazumasa Saito are his dandan noodles and soy-sauce ramen which secrets to their insanely good taste is the broth.<br>
                        A mix of chicken, beef bones, oysters and kombu all cooked in one pot.<br>
                        With every ingredient's umami adding its own layer for this deeply flavorful bowl of pure taste. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Nakiryu chef Saito draws to his experience in China and seasons his dandan noodles with home-grown sesame paste and chilli oil.<br>
                        The flavours that are in just one bowl make so much sense and you will understand why he earned himself a Michelin star.<br>
                        The dandan are the house speciality but the soy-sauce Ramen is not less flavorful. It is made from multiple soy sauces which make a rich, weighty and though light flavour.

                    <p>
                        ICHIRAN’s menu is focused only on tonkotsu Ramen.<br>
                        With focus being their mantra the dining experience is also all about focusing on your bowl of richness in the setting of your very own booth.<br>
                        It’s a must try and you can find them scattered around Tokyo. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The broth is made with natural pork-bone which is skimmed to perfection so that the ultimate flavor of pork is drawn out.<br>
                        The special raw noodle is made from a unique blend of flours to make the synergy between noodle and soup perfect.<br>
                        All this is then topped off with the original spicy red sauce.

                    <p>
                        Fuunji (風雲児) has a specialty called Tsukemen style Ramen. It is located in Shinjuku Tokyo’s hub for Ramen shops.<br>
                        Fuunji probably is one of the most popular restaurants in Tokyo and doesn’t only attract foreign Ramen lovers but also a lot of locals. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tsukemen (dipping noodles) is a different style of Ramen. The noodles and soup are served seperatly.<br>
                        The stock is made out of chicken and fish and has the most rich and aromatic taste you can imagine.

                    <p>
                        With Ramen Hayashida being my personal favorite I’m unsure why they don’t have a Michelin star.<br>
                        But who know maybe they’re cooking one up just right now.<br>
                        They have a few must tries. Defnitly their classic duck and chicken broth that is served since 2017. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The trending bowl is their seafood broth based on the famous Nodoguro.<br>
                        The fish is typically served as sashimi or braised but Hayashida figured out how to make an amazing broth with it and this surely deserves at least one Michelin star.
