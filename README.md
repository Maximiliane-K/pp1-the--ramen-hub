## **Background**
 One of my great passions is traveling and I was lucky enough to be able to visit Tokyo. For foodies like me the city is culinary heaven but at the same time a real nightmare, when it comes to options.

I love Ramen and Tokyo has over 10 000 Ramen houses to choose from.  I have tried several different shops and wanted to share my favorites. Since there are so many different styles of Ramen, I tried to include a variety and of course the only two Ramen shops with Michelin Stars. 

So, if you plan on visiting Tokyo, I hope *The Ramen Hub* will be helpful when making the choice of which restaurant to visit. 

## **Strategy**
The idea behind *The Ramen Hub* is providing a site where travelers can find a handful of Ramen shops in Tokyo. Since the city is so huge and food is an essential part of the culture options seem endless, and all the information can be overwhelming. Travelers having difficulties with the mostly Japanese websites can find short descriptions in English that will give them a foretaste of the restaurants specialty Ramen.

## **Scope**
The Scope of this project is creating a website with the HTML and CSS framework. Users can find a curated list of Ramen shops in Tokyo with English descriptions of the restaurants, the locations on google maps and are provided with the links to homepages of the shops. Users can also submit their own favorite Ramen shop to eventually grow The Ramen Hub.

## **Design Choices**
**Color Palette**

The idea behind the color palette was reflecting the mood of a typical alley in Tokyo by night.  With red lights from lanterns reflecting on the dark street.
